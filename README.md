# Ready-Set-Boole
Ready, Set, Boole!


## workspaces

As described in the docs I create a directory for the workspace:
```
$ mkdir ready_set_boole
$ cd ready_set_boole
```

Then I manually create the Cargo.toml file:
```yaml
[workspace]
resolver = "3"
```

Because the subject asks me for a "main" to test the single exercises I will add a binary called ready_set_boole_main just to run and play with the whole thing, Not really needed because each module-exercise will have a main, a lib.rs file with functions and tests.

after creating the files manually I just need to add :
```rust
cargo new ex00 --lib
```
and so on for each new exercice. I will add the main.rs file manually as required by the subject so everyone is happy.

## Ex00

it will have this function signature in ex00:
```rust
fn adder(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32;
```

and I will add the following in the "main" top binary module so it will find the functions:
```
[package]
name = "ready_set_boole_main"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[dependencies]
ex00 = { path = "../ex00" }
```

This is in the cargo.toml in the ready_set_boole_main module which is just to play with the code and test all those modules together.
